# How To Use

You can launch ScriptStar from both your `/Applications` folder, and via the Final Cut Pro Workflow Extensions button in the toolbar and menubar.

Once launched, simply drag your **Final Cut Pro Library** into the drop zone to get started.

You can then import any SRTs to replace Final Cut Pro's built-in transcription:

Everything will be automatically imported into Final Cut Pro.

You can then export a `CSV`, Word Document or `PDF`.
