## Why do you need this?

Final Cut Pro v12 transcribes your source clips, which is useful, but you can’t see them directly, so have to know what to search for.

You also can’t send transcripts to your clients, so they can tell you the parts of an interview they want to use.

Also, Final Cut Pro only transcribes in English.

ScriptStar solves all these problems at once.

Import your clips into a Final Cut Pro library as usual, and organize them into events if you like.

Launch ScriptStar, as an app, or from the Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension menu, then drag your Library into its drop zone.

If you like, choose the events you want to process, then proceed.

At this point you can replace any of the built-in transcripts by dragging in `SRT` files that match the names of any of your existing clips. This is great for foreign languages, or if you’ve had clips transcribed or edited by humans.

Final Cut Pro now has the named favorites, but there’s one more optional step with ScriptStar. If you want to send you clients a timed transcript, so they can highlight the most important phrases in interviews, you can now export a `CSV` for Numbers or Excel, a Word doc, or a `PDF`. Save these, send them to clients, and just ask them to highlight any lines they really like or really hate.

Back in Final Cut Pro, look for the events with the star in the name, and twirl each clip’s disclosure triangle to see every line of transcribed dialogue. Select the lines you want and drag or tap E to add them to a timeline.

Final Cut Pro’s search still works, but if you want to search through the favorites, choose favorites only in this menu, to see each line on its own.

Transcripts are usually pretty accurate, and because pauses aren’t transcribed, you can skip the pauses by selecting all the favourites and adding them to a timeline.
