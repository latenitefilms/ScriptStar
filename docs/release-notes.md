# Release Notes


### 1.3.3 (Build 18)

**🎉 Released:**
- TBA, February 2026

**🔨 Improvements:**
- It’s now possible to drag a **Library** or **one or more Events** to ScriptStar. If an Event is dragged, the Library location must be chosen in a following step. This allows users to save processing time in large libraries, and also to avoid bugs related to processing some clips in other events.

- This release also adds a Show Options button to the page where SRTs can optionally be added. Press this button to choose the conversion mode. Please refer to the online [How to Use](/how-to-use/) page for more information on these modes.

  - Named Favorites
  - Named Favorites on current Favorite ranges only
  - Notes on Keywords

- All transcription formats (CSV, Word, PDF) can now be exported at once with a new button below the individual format choices. 

- A bug related to handling of clips at 47.95fps was fixed.

- FCPXMLKit 1.3.2 was incorporated.

### 1.2.0 (Build 14)

**🎉 Released:**
- Friday 20th February 2026

**🔨 Improvements:**
- This release added a new way to send transcripts into Final Cut Pro. You can continue to use the **Named Favorites** workflow, or alternatively you can use the new **Notes on Keywords** workflow. This creates multiple keyword ranges, using the same ⭐️ name, with the transcription placed on the **Notes** column in the Final Cut Pro Browser. To isolate individual lines of dialogue in search in this mode, select the ⭐️ keyword collection, then search at the top of the browser.
