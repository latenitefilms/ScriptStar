# Frequently Asked Questions

### What languages does ScriptStar support?

**ScriptStar** doesn't actually do any of the transcription (currently) - it's just a way to get transcription data into a useful format in Final Cut Pro.

By default it uses the transcription data that **Final Cut Pro v12** automatically generated by default in English.

However, you can import `SRT` files for ANY source - so you can use whatever tool/workflow you want to generate the transcriptions.

So yes, if you have Bulgarian SRTs for example, you can use **ScriptStar** to import them into your Final Cut Pro Browser.

### How should I create my `SRT`s?

When working in English, you can create them as **Captions** in a Final Cut Pro timeline, then export them as a `SRT`.

This gives you great control, and you can perfect the timing.
