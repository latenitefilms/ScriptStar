Select one or many clips, right-click, choose Analyze and Fix, and check Transcribe in English in the dialog that appears.","However, If you'd prefer to use your own transcripts, which is necessary for non-English captions, you can provide an SRT file that will be used in place of the built-in transcripts."]},{"l":"Launch ScriptStar","p":["With clips transcribed, you can now launch ScriptStar from either your /Applications folder, or via the Final Cut Pro Workflow Extensions button in the toolbar and menubar."]},{"l":"Drag a Library or Event(s) to ScriptStar","p":["Once launched, simply drag your Final Cut Pro Library or one or more Final Cut Pro Events from the Final Cut Pro Browser interface into the drop zone in ScriptStar to get started.","If you dragged one or more Events, you will now have to locate the Final Cut Pro library in the Finder — the Library's location isn't included in data dragged from Events.","If you dragged in a Library, you will also need to locate the Library in the Finder, but the location will be chosen for you, and this process is only needed the first time you work with a new Library.

The process is simpler, and as ScriptStar is told the location of the Library, you can save a step. However, if you're working with larger Libraries, dragging in just one or two of your Events may process more quickly.","Working with Events can also avoid some issues we've seen with FCP. Specifically, if you have some kinds of PDFs stored in your Library, you may not be able to export and then re-import an FCPXML file of that Library back into Final Cut Pro — even if you don't use ScriptStar at all!

If you don't do this, searches return the entire source clip.","Scriptstar works with regular clips and Multicam clips, and it's a great way to find not just dialogue, but anything said out loud during a shoot.","If something great just happened, or there's anything else you need to remember, say it out loud and you'll see it in your Browser during the edit.","Lastly, if you had already applied Favorite ranges to clips or clip ranges before using ScriptStar, they will be converted into a new keyword called Favorites ⭐️. Each converted event will include this keyword collection, and you can apply this keyword the same way you would have applied favorites before.","For example, you can now select any line of dialogue, then drag it directly into the Favorites ⭐️ keyword collection to tag it.","However, if you wish to continue to use traditional Favorites to organize B-roll clips, while using ScriptStar's transcript favorites and Favorites ⭐️ keywords to organize A-roll clips, that's easy. Simply move these two types of clips into separate events, and don't process the event containing the B-roll clips."]},{"l":"Show Options and Alternative workflows","p":["At the final stage before processing, where SRTs can be added, the Show Options button allows two alternative workflows to be chosen.

In Notes on Keywords mode, you must select the ⭐️ keyword collection (instead of choosing Favorites) to see single lines in search results.","The transcript is now in the Notes category, so you’ll have to make sure it’s wide enough to see the transcript. If you were already using clip names to carry information this may leave you a little short of space.","This means existing Favorites and related functionality are maintained — allowing you to search for Favorites across an entire library — but it has two downsides.","This will suit users who like to Favorite their clips before adding transcripts, and who only want to see transcripts in those areas.
